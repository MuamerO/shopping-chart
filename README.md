E-commerce website project I'm working on. It is still a work in progress but I'm planning to make it functional fully as an example of my skills. 



The project was done using React JS. The goal of this project is to learn and explore different problems that I'm coming across, even though it is possible to find tutorials and just write along with the mentor, I believe that though it will take longer it will help me learn and polish my skills as I will come across many challenges that I will try to solve my own way.

I'm not working on the backend but I did make a Firebase database and I'm fetching data from the database instead of just making a fake API or pulling data locally from the storage. Initially, it was created to pull locally but by the time it is finished, it is planned that the site will work by making requests to the database and pulling data from it.

For this purpose, I created another application that is giving an option to name collection on Firebase and to populate it from the JSON file that you create.
Project can be found on my github.
